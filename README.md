# Misc
1. [Query2box](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgr4kSFDS)'ICLR2020, which uses box embeddings to reasoning over KGs in vector space
# Data augmentation
## Focus on graph
1. [NodeAug](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3394486.3403063)'KDD2020, which does data augmentation(change attributes of related nodes and change graph structure by adding or removing edges) on each node separately, and uses subgraph mini-batch training(subgraph can be seen as a receptive field); this work focuses on semi-supervised node classification task.
